Imagine the dilemma of being a preacher in the Church of Christ who starts to 

There are Biblical words that we do not use that are applicable, but because we use other verses that conflict our definitions of words, then we don't get the meaning.  

Example: 
* forever.  When God refers to his covenant as forever, then we have a belief that God changed "forever" to mean "until further notice"  

* law.  We have coopted the definition of law from what it meant in the Hebrew to a 20-21 century perspective of what law is.   it's no longer "mitzphah" but bound by legal terms.  

Further, many have framed the New Testament writings up as if they are a coded legal reference for religion in the modern day.  This works best in the writings of the Apostle Paul, but they simply fall apart in the writings of the teachings of Jesus.  Parables, similes and metaphors have a hard time fitting into legal language.  

But what we want to focus on today is prophet.  Are there still prophets today?  Raise your hand-- why or why not?
