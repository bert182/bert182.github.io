Mark 15:32	even this can sound like a religiousy answer--- but God had other plans.  Like when he brought Israel out of Egypt.  He had plans to water them-- because he knew they needed water-- before they started complaining.  This morning at mens breakfast discussion came to wealth and riches and lawsuits-- and car crashes with a moose.  silly how silly would it be to sue a moose? Definitely not deep pockets.  Wealth is a fine line and it is nothing after a scaled down FOREX.  Only thing that matters is TRUST IN THE GOD WHO LOVES AND CARES FOR ME.	silly
