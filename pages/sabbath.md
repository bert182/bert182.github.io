Mark 15:1	I reckon the reason we count three days is how important it is to actually be dead.  Time of death is a scientific data point.  Just like the time of birth is.  THREE DAYS is not a huge deal a such as what day it was: sandwiched between the day of preparation and the first day if the week is the Sabbath.  Friday closes out the week.. Close down all accounts and clean house-- all things are ready; Sunday is a new beginning.  Lets go with fresh legs from the rest... Let's do this a man on a mission.
Psalm 92:1
