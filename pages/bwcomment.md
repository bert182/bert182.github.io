1 Samuel 14:6	
1 Samuel 14:6	my general impressions so far is that Samuel doesn''t get as much ministry coverage as I thought. He was already old by the time Saul came around. Israel was on a path of destruction. The captivity seems inevitable even now.
1 Samuel 31:4	
1 Samuel 31:4	(2011) - I was equipped with an expectation of failure with the reading of the law and history. We're dealing with people here. The only thing that can make it different is by attaching ourselves to God's over-arching purposes.
2 Chronicles 18:28-34	
2 Chronicles 18:28-34	Allison''s Bible: Sometimes this part of the Bible is real hard to read and it doesn''t always make sense. One thing that helps is to understand that the Bible is not just a bunch of random information but a unified story. The story is exactly what you would guess--Jesus and how God planned for Him to redeem the world. Redeem= not just a churchy word like \\"save\"\" even though these are true they have been used so much their meaning may be empty. Redeem is the idea that God concluded early in his dealings with man that it is easy just to kill them and start over. (see Noah''s generation and the flood) But wouldn''t it have a lot more glory for God if broken people get fixed--and can talk about how far God has brought them? This is what it means when God saves and redeems. He is giving those who have royally screwed up the new life to grow and change and show all people how good of a job God does in changing bad people hearts into good people hearts. That is God''s pleasure and it is His great joy. THE WORLD--Remember John 3:16--God so loved the church people that... no? So it really means that the \"\"world\"\" is not the arch nemesis of the church but the very people who God wants to administer the new life. That simply put is the story of the Bible. Remember God and His promises that He has always fulfilled them... that your very faith is based upon God''s ability to be faithful (see Romans 4:21) There are traces of Christ in the Bible especially in the prophets. But the story of Gods faithfulness is definitely on every page. It comes out sometimes in jealousy because He desires His love to be returned to Him from the heart. It comes out in forgiveness. He always restores his people. He punishes sometimes to be faithful to His standard of Holiness... but all of His faithfulness is summed up in Christ. He lived like us. Died like us. And he was raised from the dead like we will be. God is love."

John 4:1	Some say that only after the cross was salvation instituted (and even that word instituted is a cue that its probably going to get stuff here) So... the question/problem:  These Samaritans in John 4:39-42 has a (ahem) Jesus Seminar-- whos to say their belief or some other Jesus centered event didnt do it for them? see Matthew 15:13
