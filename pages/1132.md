That is Gods people would be bound to be wanderers without a home. Some people get upset about a God who would DE-Home so many people back in the days-- the moral dilemma is really the same as it is when all people were destroyed in the flood. Its not that so many people were destroyed but that so few were saved. Choices were made between living a self-indulgent life or to indulge in righteousness. IN one choice is LIFE"
