Joshua 7:1	Broke faith- Deuteronomy 32:51. broke faith is in reference to disobeying the authority. From my American culture there are negative connotations with \\"authority\"\"-- but in this case and the ones referred to in Deuteronomy the authority is the \"\"enforcer\"\" of the binding contract of the terms of the relationship. \"Faith\" is often a believe-it-or-not CHOICE-- rather than acknowledgement of the authority. But here breaking faith has more to do with covenant breaking.  "
